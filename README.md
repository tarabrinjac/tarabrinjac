## Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jacob âš¡

My goal is to become a professional web developer. I love the web for its openness, accessibility, and friendly community. I am inspired by the need to constantly learn and improve. Every day I strive to discover something new, and this continuous growth is what drives me forward.
